Situation:  

There are many restaurants spread geographically around this world. In this situation, customers cannot easily decide which restaurant is better.
There are many requirements from the customer side where the customer wants to decide on restaurants based on the cuisines, whether the restaurant is delivering food or not, and previous customers’ ratings.



Task 

The task was to develop a solution to fulfil customers’ requirements where customers can decide on restaurants based on the cuisines, whether the restaurant is delivering food or not, and previous customers’ ratings.
The solution predicts the best restaurant filtered by region or country.


Approach:

The approach I took was 
1. To Perform a preliminary data inspection
2. Explore the geographical distribution of the restaurants, finding out the cities with the maximum/minimum number of restaurants.
3. Explore how ratings are distributed overall.
4. Ratio between restaurants that allow table booking and those that do not?
5. Percentage of restaurants providing online delivery
6. The difference in no. of votes for the restaurants that deliver and the restaurant that don’t
7. The top 10 cuisines served across cities


Result:

As a result, I develop the dashboard to help users explore the data and better understand the restaurants to identify the ‘’star’’ restaurant.

I see that there is no single variable that affects the rating strongly. However, table booking, online delivery, avg price for two and price range, and the number of votes do play a part in affecting the rating of a restaurant.
